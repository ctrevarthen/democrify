democrify
=========

A Mac application for democratic handling of music at parties, using libspotify.

## Building

Building this project should be pretty straightforward. Make sure you have CocoaLibSpotify.framework sitting in /Library/Frameworks, get an appkey.c file from Spotify, install the Haskell Platform (64 Bit) plus the packages happstack-server and acid-state, build and run.

More detailed instructions will follow :)
