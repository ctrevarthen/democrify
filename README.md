democrify
=========

A Mac application for democratic handling of music at parties, using libspotify.

## Building

Building this project should be pretty straightforward. Make sure you have CocoaLibSpotify.framework sitting in /Library/Frameworks, get an appkey.c file from Spotify, install the Haskell Platform (64 Bit) plus the packages happstack-server, acid-state, hastache

You should then just be able to build & run!

More detailed instructions will follow :)

## Important

Please note that this project contains a lot of Haskell code that is written in a way in which **no Haskell code should ever be written**. Please do **not** use this project as a guide on how to use Haskell! :D
